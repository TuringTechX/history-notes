# Ice Ages

- In the first 2.7 billion years of Earth, its chemistry changed as impacts
  occurred and geological layers churned.

- Around 1.8 billion years ago:
  - the Solar System moved between spiral arms of the Milky Way,
  - so there were fewer stars forming nearby,
  - and fewer cosmic hitting the atmosphere,
  - and fewer cloud formations,
  - so the crust remained hot,
  - preventing the tectonic plates from sticking to the magma below,
  - so the surface of the Earth changed very slowly,
  - so the chemical composition of the Earth remained relatively constant for a
    [billion years or so.](https://youtu.be/0sbwUeTyDb0)

- Eventually, the crust cooled enough to bind to the mantle, tectonic plates
  moved more quickly, the chemical composition of the biome changed, and the
  [Earth became a snowball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturtian_glaciation)
  for about 55 million years.

- After 12 million warm years,
  [Earth became a snowball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinoan_glaciation)
  again for about 15 million years.

- After 56 million warm years,
  [Earth became a snowball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaskiers_glaciation)
  again for about 340,000 years.

## Questions

- When did the Solar System enter the Orion arm of the Milky Way?
